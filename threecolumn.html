											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
											
										</header>
										<p>
											I became slightly interested in IT as a child when my dad purchased my first Pokémon Diamond game. I loved how you were able to use cheats in the form of putting codes into a GUI to get a Pokémon that you wanted, that wasn’t able to be obtained in the version of your game, to appear out of the tall grass. However, IT really piqued my interest when I had to start thinking of a direction career wise during my final High School year. After thinking long and hard, I began to realise my love for games and how during my VCE year, games would be one of the things I craved the most through that stressful time. It was at that point where I felt sure that I knew what I wanted, and that was to create games where people are happy to be spending many hours of their lives to it. The thought of someone enjoying my game in the future really made me happy. Thus, after locking in direction in career, whenever I started to play games, I became very curious how certain things do something, like how do guns shoot in the game of Counter Strike and the bullets register as it hits an enemy? How does an assassin throw their blade and give off a poison effect? I became very interested by how codes and programming worked in IT.

											I decided to choose RMIT as I believe it is one of the best schools in Victoria to learn about IT, the other school being Swinburne. However, RMIT University would be the smarter and more efficient choice as it is closer to my house, takes significantly less time to commute. Add the fact that from the start of our first year, we are exposed to different parts of IT, not just coding and programming. Like in User-centred Design students are exposed on how to make a good User Interface to allow consumers to have the best User Experience, subjects like this will broaden our minds on how to think a certain way and can give a competitive edge when trying to get a job. The significant amount of group work in RMIT also prepares you to be able to work as part of a team to achieve a common goal, something important in the IT Industry.  The way the course is structured, it allows students of RMIT to be prepared and trained for beyond University and into the workforce, something very important. Finally, the degree that you get at RMIT is also globally recognised, allowing the chance for worldwide travel and getting hired internationally.

											I expect that by the end of my studies, I will have learnt how to use multiple programming languages and be able to solve problems efficiently and in a timely manner, I also expect to be able to think outside the box should the need arise. I also expect to be very sound and knowledgeable in IT and have applied the techniques possessed from the studies in an IT industry or a simulation of the industry. In addition, I’m also expecting to raise my teamwork and communication skills exponentially as it is detrimental to be able to work as part of a team in the workforce to make it possible to achieve deadlines and goals.
