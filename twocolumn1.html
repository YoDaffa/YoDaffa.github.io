											<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
											
										</header>
										<p>
											After looking through SEEK.com.au, the position I found to be my ideal job is “Game Developer”. From the job advertisement, I will be joining a team of developers to complete the construction of slot machines in a fast-paced environment for the company’s online social casino. This job position particularly intrigues me when it states that it brings the best of “Aussie culture”; having a chilled and laid-back approach to work, very flexible working hours, being allowed to wear casual dress on daily basis and being able to work from home on Fridays. Meaning only having 4 days of contact with the office unlike most other regular jobs. Although the advertisement doesn’t convey the exact salary one earns, there is a “common salary” that can be seen at the bottom right of the picture and it shows that this job would be earning around 100k to 120k per annum, an irresistible amount of money that many people would take. Other things that make this job appealing is it will be very convenient commuting to and from work as there are wide arrays of transport in the CBD like trains, trams and buses. Because you are also in the CBD, it most likely means that you will be working in an office in a tall building, giving you the chance to intake the view of the aesthetic city and landscape down below whilst working.
										</p>
										<p>
											In order to acquire this job, I would need to have some hands-on experience in software development, a minimum of 3 years. Have some previous involvement in the use Java, JavaScript, Phaser, Pixi and Unity. Have a proficient use of 2d Web Games Development, the ability to have attention to detail whilst being able to produce quick results and the ability to also be able to work as part of a team effectively and efficiently. Another attribute that you would need to succeed in the role is to have great work energy and have resilience when things don’t work and to keep on hustling in order to achieve the desired result.
										</p>
										<p>
											Unfortunately, as of this day on the 24th of March 2019, I do not have majority of the skills, qualifications and experience that is advertised to have this job. This is simply because this job is for those who have graduated or close to graduating in the field of IT and have had previous experience in the industry. The only skills, qualification and experience I could claim to have would be the ability to work as part of a team highly effectively, attention to detail with the ability to get quick results and being a bag of hustle through my years of experience working in KFC and Intraceuticals. In terms of the IT part of the job, I have only experienced very basic functions of Java like System.out.println(“Hello World”) and that would be it.
										</p>
										<p>
										In order to obtain these skills and qualification, I would need to expose myself to the wide array of languages and programs. I don’t expect to be advanced in each of the languages and programs required for the job, but I do expect to know how to use each of them at least on a basic level. However, as I am currently in my first year, it would be best for me to intake all the basic knowledge given to me by the Uni and through my own private study and apply what I’ve learnt, in my second and third year by working in the IT Industry (hopefully). As employers always look and ask your previous industry experience, it is essential to get into the door of the workforce as soon as possible.
