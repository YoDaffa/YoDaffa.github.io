											To me, the tests emphasises that I am very extroverted, that I would be the one to talk, break the ice, form conversations and likely voice my opinions openly without worry on the      current work matters in a workplace environment. But although I might be opinionated, if something is logical, I am able to be swayed with an open mind due to my agreeableness. When something needs to be done, I can sense the situation and judge accordingly on what needs to be done. Although I do prefer to follow some sort of general plan and then deviate plans slightly to meet goals rather than go from scratch and attempt to do things by abstract, I would prefer some sort of steps/formula.
										</p>

											These results may mean that in a team, I might not initially give those who aren’t an extrovert a chance to speak up and give their thoughts and ideas. However, with that same extrovert trait, I will also ask and encourage the other team members to speak up and voice their thoughts and ideas to benefit the team. I am able to read and judge people’s body language decently well and as such will try to understand and behave accordingly when co-workers go through bad moods as there will be times when people just go through bad days. I also like to be active in the workplace, I cannot stay in one place for too long and as such will be taking recurrent breaks and come back to work feeling refreshed, increasing my productivity.
										</p>
										<p>
											When forming a team, I must take into account that I am best described as a tactile learner, as such it would be wise to allocate myself in a group with people of similar traits. Placing tactile with auditory and visual learners might still work, however I might forget things heard and shown quite easily, therefore requiring patience from the other team members. I need to also realise that I might emotionally illustrate my opinions within discussions. As such would need to look for people who understands that after conveying my arguments across, I will still be professional, keeping an open mind and not let my emotional personality dictate me from choosing the right choices for the team. It would be best to be formed in a group with people that are able to tolerate myself and others alike who work with frequent breaks to increase the productivity for the team.
