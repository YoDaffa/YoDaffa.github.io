											<h2>Project Idea</h2>
										</header>
										<h4>Overview:<h/h4>
										<p>
The project idea is a machine that is able to cut grass on home-owner’s properties without the need of human interaction, unlike Lawn Mower which requires a human to either push it or ride on it. The machine would need to be programmed according to the property owner’s lawn size and shape to maximise the resulting output. The device will start running once the user sets how tall the grass must be (in mm) and how short they would like to cut the grass to. These conditions need to be made in order for the program to start running. Using the height of grass to determine whether the program starts is the most efficient way and this is because if the device is used in a time interval like a weekly basis. It will be flawed, since the rate that grass grows is determined by the seasons it is in, hence making the device start conditional to time will make it flawed.

										</p>
										<h4>Motivation:<h/h4>
										<p>
											As more people in the 21st century have less time to enjoy leisure activities. Like spending time with their loved ones or simply enjoying their hobbies like playing games, I felt like this project is necessary since many people have to waste time cutting the grass on a regular basis. Since majority of people in Australia, (25 million) have lawn, this device can be advertised to a large group of people. People in Australia will then be able to have a neat and aesthetic looking lawn whilst putting in minimal effort. Also, since this device uses battery as its energy, it lessens the burden on the environment significantly unlike its predecessors, who consumes fossil fuel for it to work.
										</p>
										<h4>Description:<h/h4>
										<p>
											The function of the machine is similar to robot vacuums like Roomba, Hoover and MyGenie, but instead of vacuuming the floor, cuts the grass of Australian property owners. The design of the device needs to include powerful enough batteries to power up the blades and last the time it takes to finish cutting an Australian sized yard in the suburban and rural areas. The device needs to be programmed in order to return to a designated safe area so that it is able to be charged by the users at the end of its duties.

The device will only start if it has an adequate amount of battery and if the grass reaches a certain height the user sets its setting to, only when these 2 conditions are met will the device start doing its work. As it is not able to sense the weather, the machine will be made waterproof and by having hard shell, mild hail will not alter its duties to cut lawn. A big emergency red button will be made on top of the device in the dead centre so that users have the power to manually stop it if glitches or malfunction occurs within the device system.

Experts and professionals will need to come to the property and set the start-up settings according to the landscape of the house and the obstructions that surrounds it. Although it will be pretty safe once the professionals set it up, the device will also have a small camera in front it so property owners can watch using a monitor from inside their respective properties but also give surveillance whenever they please so they can be at ease. In case of emergencies with the device, the red button will be put into play.

The blades of the device will need to be cleaned regularly as grass will start to get attached to it after few uses. The regular blade maintenance would be simply to just flip the device upside down and use a hose to water down the grass that are stuck to the blades preventing it from ultimately getting blunt. Because of these regular blade maintenances, the battery and blades will need to be separated by a waterproof layer but still able to work side by side.

This device initially will not pick up the garden waste left behind after going over the cut grass, however once it has finished all of its cutting duties. It will switch modes to pick up the cut waste that has been left behind, the device will start and end the pick up mode after it has finished its programmed route. The device in pick up mode is simulating the same exact movement in cutting mode.

										</p>
										<h4>Tools and Technologies:<h/h4>
										<p>
											The software needed for this project would be some kind of mapping software. The mapping software will come into play so that the device is able to cut the grass according to the landscape of the property owners. There should also be some sensors installed that works very similarly to the robot vacuum as they are both similar, except one is to cut grass whilst the other to clean. The device will then know where the obstructions are like trees, fences, gates, concretes and people. It also needs some sort of clear red emergency button, so the device is able to be stopped manually. In terms of hardware, the batteries would need to be capable of making the blades spin fast enough to cut the grass. The batteries and the blades also need a cover that is waterproof and somewhat solid so that it is able to withstand rain and maybe hail. The cover of the blades and batteries also need to be very blunt so that it is approachable and friendly looking.
										</p>
											<h4>Skills Required:<h/h4>
										<p>
											One would need to be able to program the machine to cut the sections with grass in the property owner’s yard. The property owners might have a hard time setting up and getting started as this step will be very intricate and as such would need to hire experts or professionals to help get started and give their opinions on best settings. It also wouldn’t be too hard to find the software needed to map out areas of property owners since there are many devices out there that uses similar mapping software, like previously mentioned robot vacuum. But once the device gets going, the only button to remember would be the big red emergency button, pressing that will stop all activities from the device.
										</p>
											<h4>Outcome:<h/4>
										<p>
											If the project is successful, the outcome will mean property owners won’t have to worry about cutting the grass as there is now this machine that will do everything for you. This will greatly help those who suffers from the pain of pushing lawn mowers over large properties, taking an abundance of leisure time to simply cut the grass for it to grow back. Since the device will be new like a prototype, it will also create newer opportunities for upgrades, maybe the next phase of this device would be changing from battery powered to solar powered.
